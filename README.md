# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# FriendsBook (Project 5 - Social Media Application)

FriendsBook is inspired of Facebook where you can easily sign up, log in, and share your posts. It's a simple and fun social media app where you can see what your friends are up to and share your own updates. You can post text, pictures, and more to keep everyone in the loop. It's all about staying connected and having a good time with your online friends!

# What I Did

**User Authentication with Firebase Auth**

Implemented Firebase Auth for secure user registration and authentication.
Created a user-friendly interface for account creation and login.



**Manage your Posts and Stories**

    I've added a commenting feature, allowing users to share thoughts on friends' posts, fostering engaging conversations. Additionally, I've implemented an "add story" and "add post" feature, giving users the ability to edit and delete their posts for a more dynamic and personalized social experience.



**Comment Section**

    You can post comments on your friends' posts, making the whole experience interactive and lively. Share your thoughts and keep the conversation goingâ€”it's the perfect way to enjoy the social vibe!



**User Search**

    Implemented a user search feature in FriendsBook, allowing users to easily find and explore profiles. Now, you can search for other users, visit their profiles, and stay updated on their latest posts. It adds a personalized touch to the social experience, making it simple for users to connect and share within the community.



**Image Storage with Firebase Storage**

    Utilized Firebase Storage for storing and managing users, stories and posts images.
    Implemented a seamless process for associating images with employee profiles.



**Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS and DAISY UI**

    I utilized Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI for modals and additional design enhancements in FriendsBook, ensuring a clean and stylish user interface.

**Utilized React Hooks for State Management**

    **useState()** for managing variables throughout the page.
    **useEffect()** to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    **useContext()** to access data from other components.
    **useOutletContext() **for globally accessible authentication.
    **useParams()** for redirecting based on users ID and posts ID.
    **useNavigate()** for seamless navigation between pages.
